Added LLM character archetypes and dynamic profession assignment

- Defined six main LLM character archetypes (e.g., Gloomy, Cheerful, Sad, Crazy, etc.).
- Professions are assigned dynamically within prompts instead of being hardcoded in the dataset.
- This approach allows for adding new buildings dedicated to specific professions in the final milestone.

- The supervisor should generate an initial prompt for each NPC at the start of the game.
- In the second semester, the supervisor can be expanded to generate random events.

Planned building ideas:
- Well
- Mill
- Blacksmith
- Farm
- Ruler's building
- Potter's workshop
- Inn/Tavern
- Church (Priest)
- Cemetery
- Bathhouse
- Market
- Lazaret
- Dungeon
- Gallows

Additionally, we found a modeling software for creating buildings in Unity that also includes free assets.
