## Tested Models
- `gemma-3-4b-it`
- `mistral-7b`

## Purpose
Evaluate the ability of language models to assign **Relevance** scores to new memories in a mystery narrative game using only prompt-based inference — **without fine-tuning**.

## Prompt Template

```
You are a memory analysis model in a mystery narrative game.
Your task is to assign a Relevance score (1–10) to a newly obtained memory.

Definitions:

"core_memories": Permanent, unchanging truths or world context. Always available.

"obtained_memories": Episodic memories discovered over time, formatted as:
<id - hour date - content - total weight - Recency.Importance.Relevance>

Relevance (last value in the weight triplet) measures how strongly the new memory connects to the central mystery and existing information. It is not a measure of importance in isolation — that is covered by the Importance score.

Instructions:

1. Carefully analyze the new_memory.
2. Compare its content with:
   - core_memories
   - obtained_memories
3. If the new memory connects directly or indirectly to one or more existing memories or core truths (same symbols, items, locations, actions, or implications), assign a higher Relevance.
   - Strong connections (shared specific items, rituals, locations, etc.): Relevance 7–10.
   - Moderate thematic or suggestive links: Relevance 4–6.
   - Weak or no clear links to existing data: Relevance 1–3.

If the new_memory clearly connects to one or more obtained_memories, increase the Relevance of those memories accordingly.

Updated Relevance values must never exceed 10.

Output format must be **exactly**:

New memory Relevance: <value>

Updated memories:
<id> - <new Relevance value>
<id> - <new Relevance value>

If no memories are updated, output:

Updated memories: (none)

Do not explain your reasoning. Do not include anything else.

## Evaluation Results

### ✅ gemma-3-4b-it

This model performed **very well**, demonstrating contextual understanding and successfully identifying connections between new and previously obtained memories. It followed the instructions precisely and adjusted relevance values in multiple cases. Occasional misjudgments were observed, but overall it shows promise for non-finetuned inference in narrative logic tasks.

### ❌ mistral-7b

This model **struggled significantly**. While it often assigned reasonably appropriate Relevance scores to new memories, **it failed to update any previously obtained memories** (with only **one exception**, and even then broke format). It did not demonstrate an understanding of inter-memory relationships or follow the prompt's expectations for inference and updating.

1. "New - 10:00 01.04.2025 - A blood circle was drawn in ash behind the bathhouse.",
New memory Relevance: 8

## Conclusion

- **gemma-3-4b-it** appears well-suited for **structured inference tasks** involving narrative logic, pattern recognition, and memory linking — even without fine-tuning.
- **mistral-7b** underperformed in this context. Its failure to modify memory states suggests a lack of persistent reference tracking or instruction adherence.

---

## Recommendations

- Use `gemma-3-4b-it` for memory management logic and dynamic relevance scoring in mystery/narrative games.
